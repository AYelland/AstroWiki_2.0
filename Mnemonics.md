## Stellar Populations

> [!tip] If you're young and rich, you're number 1!
> Young, metal-rich stars = Population I stars

## Inclination Angle

> [!tip] An inclination of zero makes a zero "$0$" in the sky.
> When $i=0$, the orbital plane and observing/sky plane are aligned. So, the orbit of the secondary body with make a "0" shape as it progressing about the primary body.

## Spectral Classification - Sun

> [!tip] The sun is a G2V star because its *GrooVy*.

## Stephan Boltzmann

> [!tip] Stephan-Boltzmann goes for a walk with you.
> $\sigma = 5.67 \times 10^{-8} \; {\rm W \, m^{-2} \, K^{4}}$
> 5 to 6 to 7 to 8

## Radiation Energy Transport

> - Hot-headed people throw plates $\implies$ radiation energy transport.
> - $T$ = taller letter = higher power = 3
> - $r$ = shorter letter = lower power = 2
> 
> $$\frac{\mathrm{d} T}{\mathrm{d} r} = -\frac{3}{16 \pi} \cdot \frac{\kappa_{R}}{a c} \cdot \frac{\rho L}{T^{3} r^{2}} \hspace{1cm} \text{where} \hspace{1cm} a = \frac{4 \sigma}{c}$$

## Flux-Luminosity Relationship

> [!tip] Flux-Luminosity
> Different ways to remember it?
> - We all LAF (laugh) at the idea of trying to remember this equation. $\implies L = A \cdot F$
> - **F**lux **A**nd **L**uminosity = FAL $\implies F \cdot A = L$

## Cosmology Epoch Scaling-Dependence

> [!tip] 21 Savage comes before Numbers
> To remember the scaling relations for overdensities $\delta$ and scale factors $a$ with time $t$ in radiation and matter dominated epochs (of an [[Friedmann Equation|FLRW]] universe), for some reason I find it easy to remember the exponents this way (radiation happens first in the universe)
> 
>  - Rad-dom: $\delta \propto a^{2} \propto t^{1}$            (**21**, like the savage, or the drinking age in the US)
>  - Matter-dom: $\delta \propto a^{1} \propto t^{2/3}$     (**123**, like the first 3 numbers)
>  
>  So, I guess just remember 21 and 123.

## Tully Fisher vs De Vaucouleurs

> [!tip] Fishing vs Haughty Old Guy
> [[Velocity dispersion#Tully-Fisher Relation]] is for spirals because whirlpools are in the ocean where fish live 🐟.
> [[Velocity Dispersion#Faber-Jackson Relation]] is for ellipticals because ellipticals are old and haughty (puffed up). And quarters were invented in the past so thats why its 4.

## Kepler's 3rd Law

> [!tip] Aw Good Morning 321
> To remember [[Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion#Kepler's 3rd Law]] just remember "aw good morning 321" 
> $$a^{3} \omega^{2} = G M$$

## Mass of SMBH

> [!tip] H(uh) $\beta$(ig boy)
> 
> To measure the mass of a [[Black Hole#Supermassive Black Hole|SMBH]]: use the H$\beta$ lag to tell if it's a H(uh) $\beta$(ig boy)

## Virial Theorem

> [!tip] Its a TUTU
> Helps to not mess up the virial theorem signs: The virial theorem is a "TUTU"  (from 2 and TU and the RHS is the top-down view of a tutu).
> $$2T + U = 0$$

## Spacetime Curvature

> [!tip] Open or Closed?
> 
> To remember whether $\Omega_{k}$ positive or negative means an open or closed universe in the context of the [[Friedmann Equation|FLRW]] metric, just remember that a sphere is closed because I'm trapped inside it, and I have very **negative** feelings about this trapping (so $\Omega_{k} < 0$ is **closed**). We talk about $\Omega_{k}$ more than $k$, but just remember that they have a minus sign relative to one another so a negative $\Omega_{k}$ means a positive $k$ and vice versa.

> The [[Galaxy Profiles#Einasto Profile]] is nice because it has a well-defined total mass. Ei**mass**to.

## Lyman Hydrogen Transitions

> [!tip] Long Lyman Lines
> The [[Spectral Features#Lyman Series|Lyman]] transitions are to the $n=1$ energy because on this plot they are the **L**ongest. 
> Those LONG Lyman lines.

## Binding Energy of Deuterium/Deuteron

> [!tip] DEUCEterium
> Deuterium has a binding energy of $2.22\,\pu{MeV}$ because deuceterium. two.

## Eddington Limit

> [!tip] "$L$oo$\kappa$, its a '34 GMc Eddington!"
>
> $$L \cdot \kappa = 4 \pi G M c \hspace{1cm} \Leftrightarrow \hspace{1cm} L \approx 3 \times 10^{4} \; \left(\frac{M}{M_{\odot}}\right) \left(\frac{\kappa_{\odot}}{\kappa}\right) \; L_{\odot}$$
> - Eddington sounds like a car model
> - GMC is a car company $\implies G M c$
> - '34 is the year of model $\implies 3 \times 10^{4}$

## Roman Telescope

> [!tip] The Roman Empire was BIG
> The [[Instruments#Roman|Nancy Grace Roman Telescope]] is an IR telescope with a very large FOV, like the Roman empire... it was also big.
