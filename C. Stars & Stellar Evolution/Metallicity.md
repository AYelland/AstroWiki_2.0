**Metallicity** measures the abundance of the elements heavier than hydrogen and helium (such as carbon, oxygen, iron, â€¦). In stellar astrophysics, metallicity usually refers to the abundance of iron and is defined as the iron-to-hydrogen ratio $\ce{[Fe/H]}$.

> [!note] "Metals" in Astronomy
> Astronomers use the term "metals" to refer to element that is not hydrogen or helium. *(See [[_Stellar Nucleosynthesis#Periodic Table]])*

This concept is very important when classifying stellar bodies by their age, and thus sorting them into [[Stellar Populations|stellar populations]]. This comes from the underlying assumption that old stars formed with the universe had very little metals (given they form from stellar fusion reactions) and young stars form in environments that are metal-rich.

Generally, we consider the iron content of the universe to linearly increasing in time because it has the highest [[Binding Energy#Nuclear Binding Energy|nuclear binding energy]]. Hence, it can be used as a chronological indicator of nucleosynthesis. Iron is relatively easy to measure with spectral observations due to the large number of lines in the spectra. 

The abundance ratio is the common logarithm of the ratio of a star's iron abundance compared to that of the Sun, where $N_{\mathrm {Fe}}$ and $N_{\mathrm {H}}$ are the number of iron and hydrogen atoms *per unit of volume* for the sun and the subject star. 

$$\left[{\frac {\mathrm {Fe}}{\mathrm {H}}}\right]~=~\log _{10}{\left({\frac {N_{\mathrm {Fe}}}{N_{\mathrm {H}}}}\right)_{\star}}-~\log _{10}{\left({\frac {N_{\mathrm {Fe}}}{N_{\mathrm {H}}}}\right)_{\odot}}$$

Therefore, stars with a higher metallicity than the Sun have a positive common logarithm, whereas those more dominated by hydrogen have a corresponding negative value. 

$$\left[ \frac{\rm Fe}{\rm H} \right]_{\star} \quad = \quad\begin{cases}
	& &\quad \dots \\
	+2 &\rightarrow \quad 10^{+2} &\text{times the metallicity of the Sun} \\
	+1 &\rightarrow \quad 10^{+1} &\text{times the metallicity of the Sun} \\
	~~~0 &\rightarrow \quad 10^{0} &\text{same metallicity as the Sun} \\
	-1 &\rightarrow \quad10^{-1} &\text{times the metallicity of the Sun} \\
	-2 &\rightarrow \quad10^{-2} &\text{times the metallicity of the Sun} \\
	& &\quad \dots \\
\end{cases}$$
 
> [!note] The unit often used for metallicity is the ${\rm dex}$ (contraction of "decimal exponent"). 

### Other Notes...

- [[Stellar Populations#Population III (Pop. III)|Pop. III stars]] are estimated to have metallicities close to $-6$, a millionth of the abundance of iron in the Sun.
- [[Stellar Populations#Population II (Pop. II)|Pop. II stars]] have metallicities closer to $-3.0$ to $-1.0$.
- The metallicity of a star have influence the mass and lifetime of the star, and the overall end state of how the star dies.
