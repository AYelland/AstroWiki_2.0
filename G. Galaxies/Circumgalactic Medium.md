"Circumgalactic medium". 
**Observation strategies**:
1. Observing a [[#Quasar|quasar]] behind the CGM and analysing the CGM's impact on the spectrum of the quasar.
	**Advantages**: does not depend on host galaxy's luminosity or redshift
	**Disadvantages**: Must have quasar behind
  
2. "Down the barrel spectroscopy" Observing the host galaxy's spectrum through the CGM 
	**Advantages**: Probes innermost radii 
	**Disadvantages**: depends on galaxy's flux though, lose radial position information

3. Spectroscopic cube around the host galaxy 
	**Advantages**: great spatial info
	**Disadvantages**: highly eroded by redshift, and requires dense, hot gas
